WebDNA Timeclock
================

Note: this is an unmaintained repository.

This timeclock was coded in [WebDNA v6.0](http://www.webdna.us/). Although intentioned to be used for production purposes, the code has not been used in a production environment and all such caveats must be applied.

As WebDNA is an unknown language by most, a small explanation about the language. WebDNA combines dynamic server-side scripting and database interaction into one syntax. It does not use nor require SQL syntax, as WebDNA uses tab-delimited databases stored in flat files and RAM rather than an external database like PostgreSQL. This gives WebDNA several advantages for beginners and simple websites, but imposes several limitations for complex systems.

This timeclock is a demonstration of the capabilities and limitations of WebDNA. To complement the server code, [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) was used for the design and [jQuery](http://jquery.com) (with some regular JavaScript) was used for navigation and client-side form validation. This was my first major project while learning WebDNA, so best practices for coding, formatting, and documentation weren't always followed. However the code was deemed readable by an informal peer review.
